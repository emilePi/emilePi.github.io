I recently completed my PhD on *"Stochastic Super-resolution and Inverse Problems: From Gaussian Conditional Sampling to Diffusion Models"* under the supervision of [Bruno Galerne](https://www.idpoisson.fr/galerne/) (defended on July 10, 2025).  
In this work, I studied sampling for inverse problems, with a particular focus on **stochastic super-resolution** within the mathematical framework of Gaussian image distributions and using diffusion models.  
The manuscript will be available online soon, but some of the results are presented in the *Featured Publications* section.

I’m happy to be starting a postdoctoral position in September with [Julie Delon](https://judelo.github.io).



Feel free to contact me about anything.
